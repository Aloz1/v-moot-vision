## Packages to install

We will get some packages to make our life easier, if you are for some reason running linux the Mac OS runner should work for you.

If on Windows and the Microsoft Store comes up this is a problem and Python isn't installed correctly

If on MacOS and you get a "python3 cannot be found" you probably have python 2 installed, you'll need to install python 3 for this workshop
