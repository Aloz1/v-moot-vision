## So what is this "computer vision?" thing?

Its a method of getting a computer to take in an image or video stream (say a webcam) and then getting it to process it into something useful, say for instance tell the difference [between coloured blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyfaHUa4NY), or [track a hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipdc3UOFU_M).
