## So what is this *computer vision* thing?

Its a method of getting a computer to take in an image or video stream (say a webcam) and then getting it to process it into something useful, say for instance tell the difference [between coloured blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyfaHUa4NY), or [track a hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipdc3UOFU_M).

We will be learning designed, traditional computer vision. This is not an AI in the sense of trained AI, we will instead be using our brains (woo pre trained neural networks :P ) to design the 'AI'
